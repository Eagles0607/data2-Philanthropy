# data2-Philanthropy

This is a project about 20 Cultural Institutions' philanthropy data in New York City. We tried to find out the cross giving, which a board member of museum A donates to museum B, and the board member of museum B donates back. The project is initiated in the class of Mark Hansen's data II in Columbia University. 

<h3>Data</h3>

- Carnegie Hall 
- Lincoln Center
- Met
- Met Opera

- New York Transit Museum 
- The Morgan Library and Museum
- WNET (Thirteen, WLIW, etc.)
- 92 Street Y

We extracted donor names and amounts from their annual report, by using an online service "pdftable", and turned them into a 42,955 rows csv file.
